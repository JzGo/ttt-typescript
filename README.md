# Tic Tac Toe 
## Using Typescript and React Hooks

I recently became really fascinated with React Hooks and I've always wanted to try out Typescript. So I did a few days research on both and decided: Why not get my hands dirty and try this stuff out. So this is my first project with React Hooks and Typescript.

It's definitely not perfect and the styling is nothing to write home about but I really did learn a lot. Even now I can see where I'm breaking some hooks rules and where I could probably refactor my functions and my Typescript work.

Ultimately this project made me more excited about both and I'm looking forward to spending more time with these tools.
